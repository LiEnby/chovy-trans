#Chovy-Trans
Allows you to transfer DIGITAL PS1 or PSP games from your PlayStation Portable onto your PlayStation Vita. via content mannager assistant

NOTE: This is NOT a HACK! - it is the same as if you installed the game on your PSVita then backed it up with Content Mannager

And does NOT enable piracy, you can only bring DIGITAL games you legally own on your own PSP over to PSVita no Copy Protection is broken here.

For that -- you would need : [Chovy-Sign2](https://github.com/KuromeSan/chovy-sign/)
